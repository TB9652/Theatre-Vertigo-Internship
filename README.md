## Introduction
 For the last two weeks in the C# course at The Tech Academy, I worked with several other students developing a full-scale ASP.Net MVC and Entity Framework Web application.  
Using the Scrum/Agile project management methodology, I attended the sprint planning meeting , daily scrum meetings as well as the sprint retrospective.  During the two week
sprint, I worked on front-end and back-end stories of varying difficluties to include using code first migration to seed the database with test data and creating/modifying
one of the models and styling the pages.

  Below are descriptions of the stories I worked on, along with code snippets and navigation links. I also have some full code files in this repo for the larger functionalities
I implemented.
